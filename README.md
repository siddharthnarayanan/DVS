# Dynamic Vision Sensor 

DVS128 camera from iniLabs tracking active LED markers set at specific frequencies. Marker tracking is widely used in applications like motion capture and pose estimation. The tracking algorithm would track these LEDs using the DVSâ€™s key features - High temporal resolution and temporal accuracy. The jAER framework is used for developing the algorithms and desired filtering mechanisms and new filters were designed to isolate these frequencies.
